Ask1.py - rename to threshold.py. Simple image thresholding given a specific threshold by the user.
Ask2.py - rename to affinetrans.py. Applies an affine transformation on a given image by taking in 6 parameters by the user. (affine matrix first 6 elements).
adaptive.py - Use of otsu thresholding algorithm for adaptive thresholding by calculating pixel-specific otsu-threshold from a sub-image (window). Window size of given by the user.
warp.py - Apply perspective transformation to an image, by calculating the transformation matrix manually (task of the assignment), given 4 points clicked in by the user.
