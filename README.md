## The following files were created for university assignments during the academic year of 2019-2020 for my "Computer Vision" course. The results may be incorrect or unexpected.

### Files : 

1. Ask1.py - rename to threshold.py. Simple image thresholding given a specific threshold by the user. 
2. Ask2.py - rename to affinetrans.py. Applies an affine transformation on a given image by taking in 6 parameters by the user. (affine matrix first 6 elements).

3. adaptive.py - Use of otsu thresholding algorithm for adaptive thresholding by calculating pixel-specific otsu-threshold from a sub-image (window). Window size of given by the user.

4. warp.py - Apply perspective transformation to an image, by calculating the transformation matrix manually (task of the assignment), given 4 points clicked in by the user.
